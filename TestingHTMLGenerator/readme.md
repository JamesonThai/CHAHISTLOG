# Testing for HTML Generator

This is a simple HTML Generator for Applause Newsletters for the College of Humanities and Arts. One thing to note is that this is an incomplete but nearly finished project as time constraints and tasks did not allow ample time for completition. The main thing that needs to be finished is linking node.js with the forms and putting them into the correct locations in the applause template. The end goal is to ultimately have anyone being able to create sample applause newsletters and then have the web team finetune them per specific instructions. 

## Notes

Most of the basic functionalities and fields are already implemented, the main concern is transfering the information over locally for general use. 

### Prerequisites

1) Need to download node.js
  - For node js you can just download here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Assuming you've already installed Node.js, you need to change to the directory you want to work in
```
npm install express --save
```
